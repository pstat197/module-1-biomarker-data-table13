### Q4 - Use any method to find either: 
### a simpler panel that achieves comparable classification accuracy
### an alternative panel that achieves improved classification accuracy

### Benchmark your results against the in-class analysis.

## Goal: Explore alternative feature selection

Q4: Use any method to find either a simpler panel or an alternative panel.

We chose to find an alternative panel that achieves improved classification accuracy by utilizing the pure LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) penalized regression model.


The original analysis used the intersection of three methods ($t$-test, Random Forest, and LASSO) followed by an unregularized Logistic Regression. For this alternative approach, we used the LASSO method alone to perform both feature selection and classification. The LASSO model was trained on the $80\%$ training partition, and the optimal penalty ($\lambda_{\text{min}}$) automatically selected the feature panel.

Results:

1. Alternative Panel: The LASSO model selected a panel of 43 proteins (listed in the code output).

2. Test Set Performance: The LASSO classifier achieved a Test Set AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) of $0.8578$ (Accuracy: $\approx 0.767$).


```{r}
comparison_data <- data.frame(
  Metric = c("AUROC"),
  `In-Class Analysis Benchmark (Approx.)` = c(0.825), 
  `Q4 Alternative Panel (Pure LASSO)` = c(0.8578), 
  Conclusion = c("Improved")
)

library(knitr)

kable(comparison_data, 
      caption = "Benchmark of Classification Accuracy for Alternative Panel",
      digits = 4, 
      col.names = c("Metric", "In-Class Benchmark (Approx.)",
                    "Q4 Pure LASSO Panel", "Conclusion"),
      align = 'lccc')

```


The pure LASSO approach resulted in an Alternative Panel that achieved improved classification accuracy  compared to the in-class intersection method. By using the penalized LASSO model for the final classification, we avoided the multicollinearity and numerical instability that would break an unregularized Logistic Regression model when handling this large, correlated set of 43 features. The $0.8578$ AUROC is the highest accuracy achieved in our experiments.
