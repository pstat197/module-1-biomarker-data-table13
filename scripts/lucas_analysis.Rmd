1. What is the reason for log transforming protein levels in `biomarker-raw.csv`? 

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
library(here)
rawdata <- read.csv(here("data", "biomarker-raw.csv"))

# random sample of 4 proteins to look at distributions of their levels
rand_indices <- sample(3:ncol(rawdata), 4)

prot1d <- as.numeric(rawdata[2:nrow(rawdata), rand_indices[1]])
prot1 <- prot1d[!is.na(prot1d)]
  
prot2d <- as.numeric(rawdata[2:nrow(rawdata), rand_indices[2]])
prot2 <- prot2d[!is.na(prot2d)]

prot3d <- as.numeric(rawdata[2:nrow(rawdata), rand_indices[3]])
prot3 <- prot3d[!is.na(prot3d)]

prot4d <- as.numeric(rawdata[2:nrow(rawdata), rand_indices[4]])
prot4 <- prot4d[!is.na(prot4d)]

summary(prot1)
summary(prot2)
summary(prot3)
summary(prot4)
```

Looking at the summary statistics for 4 randomly selected proteins, the mean values differ significantly, with `prot1`'s mean being 17,164 and `prot3`'s mean being $\approx 458$. `prot2`'s mean is roughly 5000 units greater than its median as well, indicating a right skew.

The log transformation of the protein levels helps compress the scale of protein levels since we have a wide range of positive values, where some are very large. Additionally, the logarithm helps with skewed data, and we have evidence that some of the data is skewed, since `prot2` has a mean much larger than its median.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(as.data.frame(prot1), aes(x = prot1)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y=after_stat(density)), bins = 30) +
  geom_density(color="red") +
  ggtitle('Protein 1 density')

ggplot(as.data.frame(prot2), aes(x = prot2)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y=after_stat(density)), bins = 30) +
  geom_density(color="red") +
  ggtitle('Protein 2 density')

ggplot(as.data.frame(prot3), aes(x = prot3)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y=after_stat(density)), bins = 30) +
  geom_density(color="red") +
  ggtitle('Protein 3 density')

ggplot(as.data.frame(prot4), aes(x = prot4)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y=after_stat(density)), bins = 30) +
  geom_density(color="red") +
  ggtitle('Protein 4 density')
```

From the density plots, `prot2` looks the most skewed (strongly right-skewed) `prot3` looks slightly right-skewed as well. Both proteins contain large outliers, however the scale of `prot2`'s protein level is much higher, so the same follows for its outliers.
